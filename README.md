# sticker-bot

A simple Discord bot I made to help keep our D&D group on track :)

Each user has a "sticker chart", like those chore charts for kids. 

Right now you can add and remove stickers, view your chart, and customize the stickers' appearance. 

Commands are prefixed by !s, use "!s help" to view the entire list.
